* In 2019, I collaborated with artists (Mahan Moalemi)[https://mahanmoalemi.com/] and (Bahar Noorizadeh)[http://www.baharnoorizadeh.com/] on the video-essay installation **CAD Conspiracy: Pattern Recognition in Contemporary Art** at the (Mosaic Rooms)[https://mosaicrooms.org/event/cad-conspiracy/].
<br/><br/>
* I generated the images of contemporary art installations via a DC-GAN for the installation.
<br/><br/>
"In the three-channel video, the installation shots of contemporary art exhibitions serve as an entry point into reflections and speculations on the politics of documentation, the history of representational technologies, and the future of empirical perception in relation to developments in machine vision."
