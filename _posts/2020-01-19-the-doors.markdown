* In 2019 -2020, we had the pleasure to work with Zach Blas on the installation The Doors. 
a multimedia installation exploring psychedelia, drug use, and artificial intelligence. It is work commissioned by Edith-Russ-Haus f√ºr Medienkunst (Oldenburg, Germany), de Young Museum (San Fransisco, US), and Van Abbemuseum (Eidhoven, the Netherlands).
* Generated 36 differently themed videos with GANs trained on images of psychadelia, pills, LSD, consciousness, etc.
* Generated 6 poems around the topic of Nootropics with the style of Jim Morrisson poetry, by training a GPT-2 on Jim Morrisson poems and finetuning the model on pharmaceuticals literature.
