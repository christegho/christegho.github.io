* In 2019 - 2020, we worked with artist [Zach Blas][zach-blas] on the installation [The Doors][the-doors-homepage]. The work was commissioned by Edith-Russ-Haus für Medienkunst (Oldenburg, Germany), de Young Museum (San Fransisco, US), and Van Abbemuseum (Eidhoven, the Netherlands).

* The doors is a multimedia installation exploring psychedelia, drug use, and artificial intelligence.
* We generated 36 differently themed videos with GANs trained on image datasets of psychedelic rock posters, LSD blotter art, brains, glass architecture, sacred geometry, broken glass, and lizard skin.

* We also generated 6 poems using a GPT-2 model trained on corporate nootropics literature and Morrison’s writing.
