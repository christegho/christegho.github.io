* I am currently working in computer vision and machine learning at [Calipsa](calipsa.io), focusing on deep learning for video analytics. 

* My interests are in Bayesian neural networks, reinforcement learning, meta reinforcement learning, variational inference and computer vision (video recognition, few shot learning, object and movement detection).

* I have extensive experience using machine learning for real world applications. My recent work includes developing a few shot detector for detecting tear gas canisters to assist investigators at Forensic Architecture with their work on human rights violations. In the past year, I have worked on image and video generation and language modelling for art installations, and research on support vector graphic generation. 

* I have executed challenging tasks throughout entire pipelines, from dealing with small amounts (as little as 10 training data points)  of data all the way to deploying ML models that serve thousands of requests per second.

* I completed my Masters in machine learning at the University of Cambridge, in August 2017. For my thesis, I worked on improving uncertainty estimates in deep reinforcement learning, through Bayes By Backprop, for the application of dialogue systems.

* In the past, I have worked as a cloud developer and consultant for an ERP consulting company in Montreal, and did my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at McGill University.
